We introduce in this thesis two entanglement detection criteria, the \textit{Schr\"odinger-Robertson partial transpose inequality}, which can be implemented experimentally in a variety of systems and generalized \textit{$N$-qubit concurrences}, which can be used to evaluate multipartite entanglement in $N$-qubit mixed states. Then, we investigate ways to experimentally produce entanglement by giving a theoretical model which successfully describes the \textit{dipole blockade} effect. We study its possible applications in systems of two and three two-level atoms as well as its relations with the \textit{EIT} effect in systems of two three-level atoms. Finally, we show the possibility of two-photon processes in a system of two two-level atoms embedded in a cavity by using perturbation theory and a full master equation approach. We unveil interesting features of blockade and transparency in such \textit{cavity QED} systems.
